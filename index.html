    <summary>About Myself</summary>
    <p>Hello! My name is Yarency, I'm a first-gen Latina at Stanford University, 
        with a passion for creativity, cs, and a concentration in 
        human-computer interaction. I took this course to learn more about HTML and 
        get an idea of front-end programming. This is my first basic HTML website ever and although it's quite simple,
        I am proud for being able to identify what tags I would need from viewing the demo project and
        being able to code this up.

        I look forward to taking on more coding projects to continue learning about web-development.
        Feel free to connect with me in LinkedIn at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yarency-avelar/">Yarency Avelar</a>
