# Final Coursera Project: Introduction to HTML5 by University of Michigan

👩🏻‍💻 Over the summer, I decided to get back into relearning the basics of HTML by taking an introductory course. Coursera's Introduction to HTML5 by University of Michigan is a one month course that breaks down the basics of HTML as well as challenges students to create their own website.

👩🏻‍💻 For my final project, I was tasked with recreating the "final project demo" website. To do so, I first analyzed the demo that was provided to us. Using what I learned about HTML5's structure, I began attempted and successfully identified components and tags used in the demo. Next, I finally began to code bit by bit my final project and compared it side by side to the demo, until I successfully coded my website. 

## Learned To: 
- Recognize the names of common Internet browsers.
- Describe how and why HTML has changed.
- Create an HTML file.
- Give examples of HTML5 tags.
- Identify self-closing tags
- Compose HTML5 code that can create images and links.
- Identify the difference between syntax and semantics.
- Identify different hosting platforms (without necessarily using them).
- Use a validator to evaluate their code.
- Evaluate the HTML code of their peers.
- Create a syntactically correct HTML page.
- Evaluate the HTML code of their peers.
